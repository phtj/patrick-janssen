# Research

Research focus areas:

## Parametric Design

Development of methods and tools for parametric design at both building and urban scales, focusing in particular on procedural modelling. The research explores approaches that integrate techniques from different fields, including architecture, engineering, animation, and geospatial. These novel approaches are able to incorporate more complex types of constraints as compared to existing approaches.

## Design Optimization

Development of methods and tools for design optimization at both building and urban scales, focusing in particular on evolutionary optimization. The research explores the optimisation of building and urban design proposals that optimize designs for various environmental and economic performance criteria, including daylight performance, energy consumption, and construction cost. The research aims to develop methods and tools that are both usable by and useful for architects and designers. 

## Spatial Semantic Modelling

Development of methods and tools that integrate geometric and semantic modelling. With these approaches, semantic information is directly attached to the topological components of geometric objects, auch as vertices, edges, wires and faces. The research explores the creation of information rich models, supporting a variety of use cases, including interoperability, analysis and simulation. 

## Building Information Modelling

Development of methods and tools that link parametric modelling to BIM. The link between BIM and other modelling approaches earlier in the design process remains problematic and difficult. The research explores automated mapping processes from lower resultion models (such as CityGML) into higher resolution models (such as IFC). 

## Spatial Computational Thinking

Development of methods and tools for spatial computational thinking.

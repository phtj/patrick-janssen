Patrick Janssen is an Associate Professor at the Department of Architecture at the National University of Singapore and is the Director of the Design Automation Laboratory. He is also Adjunct Associate Professor in Automation in Urban Planning and Design at the 3D GeoInformation research group at the Department of Urbanism, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, TU Delft. 

He received his PhD from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, his MSc in Cognitive Science and Intelligent Computing from Westminster University, and his AA Diploma from the Architectural Association.

Patrick conducts research into computational methods and tools for design exploration and optimisation at the urban scale.

## Focus areas:

**Urban Computational Thinking:** Development of visual coding methods and tools for tackling complex design problems. In general, this focuses on how urban spatial design ideas can be translated into computational procedures that are easy to understand and modify. This translation requires the application of higher-order computational principles such as generalisation, abstraction, decomposition and encapsulation. The research explores novel approaches are able to model designs with more complex types of relationships and constraints.

**Urban Parametric Modelling:** Development of methods and tools for generating and evaluating urban models. This includes a number of sub-approaches, including Parametric Information Modelling (PIM), Building Information Modelling (BIM), and City Information Modelling (CIM). In all these approaches, geometric data is integrated with semantic information by tagging topological components. The research explores the creation of geospatially located information rich models, supporting a variety of use cases, including interoperability, analysis and simulation.

**Urban Design Optimization:** Development of methods and tools for design optimization at the urban scale, focusing in particular on evolutionary optimization. The research explores the optimisation of building clusters and urban design proposals that optimize designs for various environmental and economic performance criteria, including daylight performance, energy consumption, and construction cost. The research aims to develop methods and tools that are both usable by and useful for architects and designers.

Dr Patrick is Associate Professor at the Department of Architecture at the
National University of Singapore and director of the Design Automation Laboratory. He is
Adjunct Associate Professor in Automation in Urban Planning and Design at the 3D GeoInformation
research group at the Department of Urbanism, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment at
TU Delft. He is co-​investigator in the Digital Twin-​Enabled System Resilience module at the
Future Resilient Systems, ETH Zurich.

Dr Janssen researches computational methods and tools for design exploration and optimisation at the
urban scale. Key focus areas are parametric modelling and evolutionary optimisation.

At the Design Automation Lab, he is leading a team which is developing a new generation of
web-​based methods and tools that support double-​loop learning, where goals and decision-​making
rules are modified in the light of experience. The lab has developed the Mobius ecosystem, a set of
open-​source tools for 3D design modelling and optimisation, leveraging the power of cloud
computing. Other areas of research include Geospatial Modelling (GIS), Building Information
Modelling (BIM), Virtual Reality (VR), and Participatory Design (PD).

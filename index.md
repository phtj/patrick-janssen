Dr Patrick Janssen is Associate Professor at the Department of Architecture at the National
University of Singapore and director of the [Design Automation
Laboratory](https://design-automation.net). He is Adjunct Associate Professor in Automation in Urban
Planning and Design at the 3D GeoInformation research group at the Department of Urbanism, Faculty
of Architecture and the Built Environment at TU Delft. He is co-​investigator in the Digital
Twin-​Enabled System Resilience module at the Future Resilient Systems, ETH Zurich.

Dr Janssen researches computational methods and tools for design exploration and optimisation at the
urban scale. Key focus areas are parametric modelling and evolutionary optimisation.

At the Design Automation Lab, he is leading a team which is developing a new generation of
web-​based methods and tools that support double-​loop learning, where goals and decision-​making
rules are modified in the light of experience. The lab has developed the Mobius ecosystem, a set of
open-​source tools for 3D design modelling and optimisation, leveraging the power of cloud
computing. Other areas of research include Geospatial Modelling (GIS), Building Information
Modelling (BIM), Virtual Reality (VR), and Participatory Design (PD). 

## The Möbius Ecosystem

Dr Janssen is leading the development of The Möbius Ecosystem.

The Möbius Ecosystem encompasses various open-source tools and libraries for supporting spatial
computational thinking. At the core of this ecosystem is Möbius Modeller, a parametric modelling
application for the web.
